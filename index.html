                    <p>We developed an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) furniture application that transforms the online furniture buying and selling experience by allowing users to virtually place and visualize furniture in their real-world spaces. The app leverages advanced AR technology to enable customers to use their smartphone cameras to instantly preview how specific furniture pieces would look in their home or office environment, providing a realistic 3D rendering of items from different angles and in real-time scale. Sellers can easily upload furniture listings with detailed 3D models, while buyers can interact with these virtual models, move them around their actual living spaces, and make informed purchasing decisions without the traditional guesswork of online furniture shopping. The application includes features like precise measurement tools, color and texture customization, compatibility checks with existing room decor, and a seamless integration between AR visualization and e-commerce transaction capabilities, making it a groundbreaking solution in the digital furniture marketplace.</p>
